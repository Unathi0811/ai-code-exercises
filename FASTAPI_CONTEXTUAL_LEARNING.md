# Exercise: Contextual Learning with FastAPI

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you'll practice using AI to learn FastAPI through the lens of your existing Python web framework knowledge.

---

## Part 1: Framework Comparison

### Task: Use AI to compare FastAPI with frameworks you're already familiar with

### Prompts to Try

1. **"Compare FastAPI and Flask: what concepts are similar and what's fundamentally different?"**

2. **"How does FastAPI's dependency injection system compare to Django's middleware?"**

3. **"If I'm used to Flask's Blueprint system, what's the equivalent in FastAPI?"**

4. **"How is FastAPI's request validation different from typical form validation in Django?"**

### Goal

Create a personal "translation table" between concepts in frameworks you know and their FastAPI equivalents.

---

## Part 2: Understanding Design Choices

### Task: Explore why FastAPI was designed the way it was

### Prompts to Try

1. **"Why did FastAPI choose Pydantic for data validation instead of creating its own validation system?"**

2. **"What problem does FastAPI's automatic API documentation solve that was challenging in other frameworks?"**

3. **"Why does FastAPI use type hints so extensively? What advantages does this provide?"**

4. **"What motivated the async-first approach in FastAPI compared to the synchronous approach of Flask?"**

### Goal

Write a short summary of FastAPI's design philosophy and how it influences the way you should structure applications.

## Part 3: Applied Contextual Learning

### Task: Use your prior knowledge and AI guidance to implement a feature in FastAPI

### Implementation Challenge

Create a simple FastAPI application that implements authentication using JWT tokens. If you've implemented authentication in other frameworks, ask AI to explain how the approach differs in FastAPI.

### Example Implementation

[See course materials for full JWT authentication example code]

### Reflection Questions

1. **How does FastAPI's approach to authentication compare to frameworks you've used before?**
2. **What advantages does FastAPI's dependency injection system provide for authentication?**
3. **How does type hinting in FastAPI make security implementation clearer compared to other frameworks?**
4. **What patterns from other frameworks can you identify in the JWT implementation?**

---

## Part 4: Mental Model Translation Exercise

### Task: Create a conceptual diagram or table that maps your existing mental model of web frameworks to FastAPI concepts

### Approach

1. List the key components you understand from familiar frameworks (routes, middleware, controllers, etc.)
2. Ask AI to help you map these to FastAPI equivalents
3. Note the differences in approach and philosophy
4. Update your mental model to incorporate FastAPI's unique aspects

### Example Prompt

```
"If I think of Django's middleware, views, and models as the core architectural components, 
what would be the corresponding mental model for FastAPI applications?"
```

## Key Learnings

Document your three key learnings:

1. **[Learning 1]**
2. **[Learning 2]**
3. **[Learning 3]**

## Conclusion

By completing these exercises, you'll not only learn FastAPI faster but also strengthen your understanding of web framework design principles in general, making future framework learning even easier.
