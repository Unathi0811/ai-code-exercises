# Exercise: Code Readability Challenge

## Exercise Instructions

Choose one (or more, if you have time) of the exercises in Sample Code, and follow these steps:

1. Understand the original code: Run the unit tests to make sure you understand what the code is doing
2. Apply the appropriate prompt: Use the AI prompt that best fits the readability issue
3. Implement the improvements: Refactor the code based on the AI's suggestions
4. Verify functionality: Run the unit tests again to ensure your refactored code still works correctly

**Tip:** Running unittests should be familiar to you, at least for the languages you have used. We do give some high-level pointers in Running the Unit Tests on running the unit-tests for these examples.

## Sample Code Examples

### Example 1: Cryptic Variable Names (JavaScript)

[See course materials for full code example and unit tests]

### Example 2: Missing Documentation (Python)

[See course materials for full code example and unit tests]

### Example 3: Complex Algorithm Without Comments (Java)

[See course materials for full code example and unit tests]

### Example 4: Poor Formatting and Structure (Python)

[See course materials for full code example and unit tests]

## Prompt 1: Variable and Function Naming Enhancement

### Prompt Template

```
Please improve the readability of this code by enhancing variable and function names:

[Paste code with poor naming here]

Guidelines:
1. Replace single-letter or cryptic variable names with descriptive ones
2. Ensure function names clearly describe their purpose and behavior
3. Use consistent naming conventions
4. Preserve the code's functionality exactly
5. Explain your naming choices and any patterns you've applied
```

---

## Prompt 2: Comment and Documentation Addition

### Prompt Template

```
I need to improve this code's readability by adding appropriate comments and documentation:

[Paste poorly documented code here]

Please:
1. Add a clear function/method description comment that explains purpose, inputs, and outputs
2. Add comments for complex or non-obvious code sections
3. Document any assumptions, edge cases, or limitations
4. Explain any algorithms or business rules implemented
5. Don't add obvious comments that just repeat what the code clearly says
6. Use the standard comment style for the language
```

---

## Prompt 3: Code Structure Improvement

### Prompt Template

```
Please improve the readability of this code by enhancing its structure and formatting:

[Paste poorly structured code here]

Specifically:
1. Apply consistent indentation and spacing
2. Break up long expressions into more readable parts with appropriate variable names
3. Extract complex conditions into well-named boolean variables
4. Reduce nesting levels where possible
5. Add line breaks to separate logical sections
6. Replace "magic numbers" with named constants
7. Ensure the functionality remains exactly the same
```

## Reflection Questions

After receiving the AI's suggestions, think about:

1. **How much easier is the code to understand now?**
2. **What readability issues did you miss that the AI caught?**
3. **What readability issues did the AI miss that you noticed?**
4. **Which readability improvements had the biggest impact?**
5. **How did the improved names change your understanding of the code's purpose?**
6. **What readability patterns can you apply to your future code?**
