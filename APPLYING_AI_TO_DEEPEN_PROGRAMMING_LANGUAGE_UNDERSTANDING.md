# Exercise: Applying AI to deepen programming language understanding

## Exercise Overview

**Note:** Do the activities below, and journal (i.e. document) about the three key learnings for each — we will discuss that in the group after the exercise.

This exercise helps you use AI to deepen your understanding of your current programming language through idiomatic code transformation, code quality analysis, and exploring advanced language features.

---

## Activity 1: Idiomatic Code Transformation

### Objective

Learn how to write more language-idiomatic code.

### Instructions

1. Select a function you've written recently (15-30 lines of code)
2. Use this prompt:

```
I'm learning to write more idiomatic [language]. Here's my current code:

   [paste your code]

   Could you:
   1. Suggest ways to make this more idiomatic
   2. Explain why these changes follow language best practices
   3. Point out any language features I'm not taking advantage of
   4. Show me both my version and an improved version side by side
```

3. Implement the suggestions in your codebase
4. Document 3 key learnings from this exercise

---

## Activity 2: Code Quality Detective

### Objective

Develop an eye for code quality issues in your language.

### Instructions

1. Find a piece of code you wrote 3+ months ago (or any older code)
2. Use this prompt:

```
I'm a junior developer working with [language]. Could you review this code for quality improvements:

   [paste code]

   Please:
   1. Identify any code smells or quality issues
   2. Suggest specific improvements
   3. Explain why these improvements matter in [language]
   4. Rate the code's readability, performance, and maintainability
```

3. Create a checklist of the issues identified
4. Use this checklist in your future code reviews
5. Document 3 key learnings from this exercise

---

## Activity 3: Understanding Language Feature

### Objective

Discover and learn advanced language features.

### Instructions

1. Choose an area of your language you're less familiar with (e.g., Python decorators, JavaScript generators, Java streams)
2. Use this prompt:

```
I want to improve my understanding of [specific feature] in [language].

1. Could you explain this feature with simple examples?
2. Show me 3 practical use cases where this would be valuable
3. Provide a small project idea that would help me practice this feature
4. What common mistakes should I avoid when using this feature?
```

3. Implement a small code sample using this feature
4. Share your implementation with AI for feedback
5. Document 3 key learnings from this exercise

---

## Group Discussion

Either in the bigger group, or divided into smaller groups, share your 3 key learnings for each activity, and highlight interesting code changes you made associated with one or more of those learnings (keep in mind the security and confidentiality policy of any code you worked on).

**Questions to consider:**
- Are there any common themes that popped out in the learnings?
- Which activity was most valuable for your learning?
- How will you apply these learnings going forward?

## Extension Activities

If you have more time to explore, try the suggestions below:

### Language-Specific Style Guide

Create a personalized style guide for your language by asking AI to compile best practices, then validate it against official style guides used by your team.
