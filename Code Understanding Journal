Environment Setup
I installed JAVA 17, so I can satisfy the compatibility issue I had with Gradle
Learnt that you can specify the kind of version you want for a specific project, since I wanted version 17, I had to specify like so

Main Files Identification
build.gradle.kts	          The Gradle build config file
settings.gradle.kts	          They define the whole Gradle project settings like the project name etc
Gradlew and gradlew.bat	          These are the scripts that all you to run Gradle commands without installing in, the first one being for MacOS and the second for windows
gradle/wrapper/	                  The wrapper contains files that ensure that as a team we keep Gradle versions consistent
src/main/java/...	          This is where the actual application logic lives, that’s where you have your packages, models, services, DTO’s and more
src/test/java/...	          This has unit tests, to ensure the application works as expected
README.md	                  It provides build actions and includes a list of commands you have access to. 

In conclusion this application is a command line driven, judging by the listed commands in the md file.
