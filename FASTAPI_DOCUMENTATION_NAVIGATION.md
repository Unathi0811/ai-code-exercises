# Exercise: Documentation Navigation for FastAPI

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you'll practice using AI to navigate and extract practical value from FastAPI's documentation.

---

## Part 1: Documentation Summarization

### Task 1: Use AI to create a learning roadmap based on the FastAPI documentation

### Prompts to Try

1. **"Based on the FastAPI documentation at https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/, what would be an effective reading order for someone new to the framework?"**

2. **"What are the 5 most important sections in FastAPI's documentation for a developer who needs to build a REST API quickly?"**

3. **"Summarize the key points from FastAPI's dependency injection documentation in a way that highlights practical applications."**

### Goal

Create a personalized reading guide for the FastAPI documentation that matches your learning style and project needs.

## Part 2: Documentation Deep Dive

### Task 2: Select a complex FastAPI feature you want to understand better

### Prompts to Try

1. **"I'm looking at FastAPI's WebSocket documentation at https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/. Can you explain the core concepts and why they matter?"**

2. **"What parts of FastAPI's security documentation are most relevant for building an API that requires authentication?"**

3. **"I'm confused by the Depends function in FastAPI. Can you explain its purpose and when I should use it versus when I shouldn't?"**

### Goal

Create notes that extract the essential information from a complex documentation section, focusing on practical application.

---

## Part 3: Concept to Code Translation

### Task 3: Use AI to translate abstract FastAPI concepts into practical code examples

### Prompts to Try

1. **"Based on FastAPI's documentation, show me practical code examples of dependency injection patterns for different scenarios."**

2. **"The FastAPI docs mention 'path operation decorators' - can you explain what these are and show examples of different decorators and when to use each one?"**

3. **"How do FastAPI's background tasks work according to the documentation? Show me example code for sending emails in the background after an API response."**

### Goal

Create a reference guide that connects abstract FastAPI concepts from the documentation with concrete code implementations.

### Example: Dependency Injection Patterns

[See course materials for full code examples showing dependency injection, Pydantic models, background tasks, path parameters, and exception handling]

## Part 4: Comprehensive Documentation Challenge

### Task 4: Use AI to help you build a complete mini-application based primarily on FastAPI documentation

### Challenge

Create a FastAPI application that implements a RESTful API for a simple blog with the following features:

1. User registration and authentication
2. CRUD operations for blog posts
3. Comments on blog posts
4. Basic search functionality

### Approach

1. Ask AI to identify the relevant documentation sections for each feature
2. Request summaries of key concepts for each component
3. Ask for practical examples based on the documentation
4. Combine these examples into a cohesive application
5. Have AI explain how the documentation informed the implementation choices

### Example Prompt

```
"I'm building a blog API with FastAPI. Based on the official documentation, which sections 
should I focus on for implementing user authentication, and can you provide a practical 
example based strictly on the approach recommended in the docs?"
```

**Tip:** Challenge yourself to apply what you learned, and remember to prompt in increments, focusing on one learning topic or feature at a time.

## Key Learnings

Document your three key learnings:

1. **[Learning 1]**
2. **[Learning 2]**
3. **[Learning 3]**

## Conclusion

By completing this exercise, you'll develop both the skill of navigating technical documentation efficiently and the ability to translate documentation concepts into working code—a crucial skill for rapidly learning any new technology.
