# Exercise: Understanding FastAPI Code Patterns

## Exercise Overview

This is an advanced/optional exercise for understanding FastAPI code patterns in depth.

**Note:** This exercise is mentioned in the course materials as an "Advanced Exercise" and is optional.

---

## Exercise Instructions

[This exercise would involve analyzing existing FastAPI codebases, identifying patterns, and using AI to understand how FastAPI-specific patterns work together.]

### Suggested Approach

1. Find an open-source FastAPI project or use provided examples
2. Use AI to analyze code patterns and architectural decisions
3. Understand how FastAPI-specific features are used in practice
4. Compare patterns across different FastAPI projects
5. Document common patterns and anti-patterns

### Prompts to Try

1. **"Analyze this FastAPI codebase and identify the architectural patterns being used. How do they compare to best practices?"**

2. **"What FastAPI-specific patterns can you identify in this code? How are dependencies, routers, and middleware being used?"**

3. **"How would you refactor this FastAPI code to follow more idiomatic FastAPI patterns?"**
